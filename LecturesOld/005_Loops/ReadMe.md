- When perfectly we know, how many times we want to repeat something we can use `for`
  - Basic structure

```
for (initialization; condition; update) {
// Code to repeat
}
```

## while

- When you don't know, how many time you want to repeat something, but you need a condition for stop that
  - Basic structure

```
while (condition) {
    // Code to repeat
}
``` 

## do while

- Like a while, but a bit diffeerent
  - Basic structure
