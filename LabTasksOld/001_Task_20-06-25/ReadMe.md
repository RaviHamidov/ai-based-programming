## 🟢 Task 1 : Alien Juice Calculator 🛸🥤\*\*

### 🖥 Scenario:

An alien lands on Earth and wants to mix two Earth juices together.

Write a program that:

1. Asks the user for the amount (in milliliters) of **banana juice** and **cactus juice**.
2. Calculates the **total juice volume**, and also how many glasses (of 250 ml) it will fill.
3. Display the result like a juice commercial.

🗨️ _"Whoa! That makes X ml of cosmic juice! Enough to fill Y full glasses!"_

**Concepts Used:**

- Variables
- Integer and double data types
- Division and modulus
- Scanner input

## 🟡 Task 2: **Office Supplies Audit 📦📊**

> Focus: Data Types, Logical Operators, Arithmetic, Scanner

### 🖥 Scenario:

You are auditing how many **pens, papers, and markers** your team has. You need to:

- Add up the total items
- Check if all categories have more than 10 units (using logical operators)
- Calculate the percentage each item contributes to total stock

### 🎯 Instructions:

1. Take user input for quantity of:
   - Pens (`int`)
   - Papers (`int`)
   - Markers (`int`)
2. Calculate total items
3. Check if **all items > 10**
4. Calculate individual item share (as a percentage)

## Task 3: **Annual Salary Simulation 💼🤑**

> Focus: Variables, Arithmetic, Logical Ops, Data Types (double, boolean), Scanner

### 🖥 Scenario:

You’ve been assigned to simulate salary data for an employee.

Calculate:

- Gross annual salary from monthly
- Bonus amount (10% of salary)
- Is total income more than 1 million? Use logical operator to print status

### 🎯 Instructions:

1. Ask the user for:
   - Monthly salary (double)
   - Name (optional, use `String`)
2. Calculate:
   - Annual salary
   - Bonus = 10% of annual
   - Total = salary + bonus
3. Use logical operator to check if total > 1,000,000

## 🧠 Bonus Twist (Optional Advanced):

Make the **employee’s happiness level** a `boolean` variable:
